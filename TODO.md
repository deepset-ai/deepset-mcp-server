How do we get from collection of tools to Agents that work well for defined use cases?

## Use Case Ideas
- create a pipeline from scratch
- edit an existing pipeline
- let the agent create connections in an incomplete pipeline
- resolve validation errors
- fix a pipeline based on logs
- optimize the prompt in a pipeline
- optimize retrieval in a pipeline


## Benchmark
- create test cases
- let agent run on test cases
- score:
  - pipeline validates
  - pipeline matches expected solution
  - pipeline yields search results
- dig into common validation errors to find best cases to cover
